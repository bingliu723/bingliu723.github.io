        <h2>Poems to Grandma</h2>
        <p>So I always wanted to write and my 86-year-old grandma has been my muse. <br>She is living in <a href="https://vancouverisland.travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canada</a> now and I decided to teach her some English by writing poems to her. <br>So the goal is to write a Haiku-ish poem about a subject, with the first chinese character of each row of the poem will connect phonetically to sound like the English word for that subject.</p>
