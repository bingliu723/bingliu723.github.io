    "abstract": "We revisit non-linear pricing with a parsimonious yet empirically grounded departure: each consumer has two types, a per-unit value, and a maximum demand (a finite quantity beyond which marginal utility becomes zero). This single modification simultaneously addresses two major limitations in the literature that has only been studied in isolation: the difficulty of rationalizing the prevalence of all-you-can-eat pricing (zero marginal price) in many subscription models and unlimited uses, and the restrictiveness of the single-crossing assumption that precludes any rank change in marginal utilities across types as quantity varies. We show that, when single-crossing fails, zero marginal price can be optimal, thereby linking the two limitations. In addition, the optimal mechanism can feature full consumer surplus extraction and non-monotonic allocations. Notably, the monopolist's profit-maximizing quantity may exceed the efficient quantity, overturning the standard intuition. Finally, we characterize when the optimal marginal prices rise or fall as a function of the correlation of the two types. The optimality of rising marginal prices when the two types are positively affiliated challenges the canonical quantity-discount prediction and rationalizes the widespread use of quantity premiums in utility markets, parcel shipping, and cloud storage.

    "abstract": "Countervailing incentives -- arising when an agent has an incentive to understate their type at some realizations and to overstate it at others -- are pervasive in many mechanism and market design settings such as resource pooling, auction with externalities, and multi-product monopoly pricing. This paper develops a unified framework for optimal mechanism design that explicitly accounts for countervailing incentives, presents an algorithm to compute the optimal mechanism and identifies conditions on agents' preferences under which the method applies. The algorithm enables empirical estimation of the designer’s welfare weight by matching theoretical allocations to observed outcomes. We establish that leveraging countervailing incentives can increase designer surplus and that a `quantity' premium is a general feature of optimal mechanisms when agents have linear utilities. Finally, we derive comparative statics for agents’ worst-case payoffs: counterintuitively, uniformly worsening one agent’s outside option can increase other agents’ worst-case payoffs."

    "abstract": "Analysing otherwise standard monopoly and oligopoly models in which consumers’investments improve product quality, we show that the effects of market power on consumer and social surplus easily dwarf those in models without investments. Pro-hibiting mergers that are profitable once investments are sunk can be Pareto improving because, under Cournot oligopoly, industry and per-firm profit before investment need not be maximized at monopoly. Price ceilings inhibiting profit maximization ex post can increase everyone’s welfare by creating commitment firms with market power lack. Accounting for consumers’ investment incentives also opens scope for socially deficient free entry and, thereby, for industrial policy."

    "abstract": "Externalities, while relevant in the real world, are, according to common practice, not accounted for in market design. This paper shows when the common practice is justified even though externalities matter for the eﬃcient allocation of resources and derives the direct mechanisms that allocate eﬃciently, endow the agents with dominant strategies, respect their individual rationality constraint and minimize their communicative requirements. These mechanisms and standard auction formats like the second-price auction are part of a family of mechanisms that we call partitioned VCG mechanism. In such a mechanism, each agent bids on all elements in a partition of a subset of the feasible allocations. The coarsest partitioned VCG consistent with eﬃciency minimizes the agents’ communicative requirements. It can be implemented in undominated strategies with a two-stage mechanism in which in the first stage each agent selects the partition it wants to bid on. Consequently, the designer does not need to know the agents’ preference structure to allocate eﬃciently in the presence of externalities."

    "abstract": "Consignment auctions are two-stage mechanisms to (re)-allocate emission permits. Firms are first endowed with permits and then allowed to trade them. We determine theoretically endowments that enable efficient allocation, subject to incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and no deficit. All firms prefer efficient consignment auctions to efficient standard auctions, making them politically palatable. Firms' investment incentives align with the first-best in efficient consignment auctions. Grandfathering based on efficient long-run allocations induces efficiency-permitting endowments. A simple calibration to data from Southern California's RECLAIM program validates our no-deficit assumption and shows that grandfathering provides the best theoretical match for the empirically observed endowments."
