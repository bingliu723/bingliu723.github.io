    "abstract": "A central conclusion of the economics literature on non-linear pricing is that optimal strategies involve differentiated quantity bundles with a quantity discount. However, this prediction leaves unexplained the quantity premiums widely used in utility markets, parcel shipping, and cloud storage, as well as the use of subscription and buffet pricing models. This paper explains these practices with a parsimonious deviation from the standard mechanism design model which assumes that there are some finite quantities beyond which consumers of different types have marginal utilities of zero. It shows that when consumers’ maximum demands and per-unit values are correlated, practices including quantity premiums, and all-you-can-eat pricing can emerge as features of the optimal pricing strategy. When the consumers’ maximum demands and per-unit values are negatively correlated, consumer preferences violate the single-crossing assumption used almost ubiquitously in the mechanism design literatures. We provide a method to solve the problem. The optimal mechanism can involve full surplus extraction, all-you-can-eat pricing and non-monotonic allocation. Extending beyond the maximum demand model, we show these features can remain in the optimal mechanism for consumer preferences that violate single-crossing in a more general form. Then, monopoly can lead to over-provision, illustrating that relaxing the single-crossing assumption can reverse standard economic intuitions. We show that a quantity premium (discount) is optimal when per-unit value and the maximum demand are perfectly positively (negatively) correlated and that conclusion extends to the cases when per-unit value and the maximum demand are stochastically related.

    "abstract": "Countervailing incentives – like the incentives faced by a shareholder to name a price that acts both as the selling price of their existing stocks and the purchase price of other shareholders’ stocks – are pervasive in mechanism and market design. Leveraging these countervailing incentives can make the truthful elicitation of a market participant’ valuations easier. We develop a unified framework for optimal mechanism design that explicitly accounts for countervailing incentives and provide a constructive algorithm to compute the optimal mechanism. The algorithm also enables empirical estimation of the designer’s welfare weight by matching model-implied allocations to observed outcomes. The framework yields new insights: the optimal mechanism features a quantity premium; cooperative production generates higher designer surplus than in standard exchange platform models; and optimal credible threats (uniformly worse outside options) can raise some market participants’ worst-case payoffs."

    "abstract": "Analysing otherwise standard monopoly and oligopoly models in which consumers’investments improve product quality, we show that the effects of market power on consumer and social surplus easily dwarf those in models without investments. Pro-hibiting mergers that are profitable once investments are sunk can be Pareto improving because, under Cournot oligopoly, industry and per-firm profit before investment need not be maximized at monopoly. Price ceilings inhibiting profit maximization ex post can increase everyone’s welfare by creating commitment firms with market power lack. Accounting for consumers’ investment incentives also opens scope for socially deficient free entry and, thereby, for industrial policy."

    "abstract": "Externalities, while relevant in the real world, are, according to common practice, not accounted for in market design. This paper shows when the common practice is justified even though externalities matter for the eﬃcient allocation of resources and derives the direct mechanisms that allocate eﬃciently, endow the agents with dominant strategies, respect their individual rationality constraint and minimize their communicative requirements. These mechanisms and standard auction formats like the second-price auction are part of a family of mechanisms that we call partitioned VCG mechanism. In such a mechanism, each agent bids on all elements in a partition of a subset of the feasible allocations. The coarsest partitioned VCG consistent with eﬃciency minimizes the agents’ communicative requirements. It can be implemented in undominated strategies with a two-stage mechanism in which in the first stage each agent selects the partition it wants to bid on. Consequently, the designer does not need to know the agents’ preference structure to allocate eﬃciently in the presence of externalities."

    "abstract": "Consignment auctions are two-stage mechanisms to (re)-allocate emission permits. Firms are first endowed with permits and then allowed to trade them. We determine theoretically endowments that enable efficient allocation, subject to incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and no deficit. All firms prefer efficient consignment auctions to efficient standard auctions, making them politically palatable. Firms' investment incentives align with the first-best in efficient consignment auctions. Grandfathering based on efficient long-run allocations induces efficiency-permitting endowments. A simple calibration to data from Southern California's RECLAIM program validates our no-deficit assumption and shows that grandfathering provides the best theoretical match for the empirically observed endowments."
